I am a postdoctoral scholar in the [Chang Lab](http://changlab.ucsf.edu/) at the University of Calfornia, San Francisco. My work is focused on developing a closed-loop brain-computer interface that synthesizes speech in real-time from decoded neural activity. The goal is to provide an efficient and intuitive form of communication to individuals with severe movement and speech impairments.

In 2019, I completed my PhD in the [Chang Lab](http://changlab.ucsf.edu/) through the [Joint Graduate Program in Bioengineering](http://bioegrad.berkley.edu) at UC Berkeley and UCSF. My dissertation incorporated machine learning, linguistics, neuroscience, and signal

I graduated from Rice University with a BS in Electrical Engineering in 2014.
