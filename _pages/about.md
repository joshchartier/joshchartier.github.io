I am a post-doctoral fellow in the [Chang Lab](http://changlab.ucsf.edu/) at the University of Calfornia, San Francisco. I am developing a brain-computer interface that enables people with severe movement and speech impairments to communicate via a real-time speech synthesizer that decodes neural signals of intended speech.

I also completed my PhD in the [Chang Lab](http://changlab.ucsf.edu/) through [Joint Graduate Program in Bioengineering](http://bioegrad.berkley.edu) at UC Berkeley and UCSF. My dissertation incorporated machine learning, linguistics, neuroscience and signal
                            processing to investigate [neural mechanisms underlying natural speech production](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2018/05/410606/study-reveals-brain-activity-patterns-underlying-fluent-speech) and developed [machine

I graduated from Rice University with a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering.
